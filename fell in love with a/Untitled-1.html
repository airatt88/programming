I just wanna see you smile<br>
I just wanna make you mine<br>
We can spend time, smoke away the time<br>
We can go anywhere you ever wanted, anything you ever dreamed<br>
I can make your dreams come true<br>
I'll be on my own, no crew<br>
Out here makin' these moves<br>
Singin' these big city blues<br>
I don't wanna think about you<br>
Every time I think about you<br>
I swear I fall in love again<br>
I remember everything you said<br>
Promise me it's real<br>
Girl, I got a deal<br>
You could be my girl if I could be your world<br>
Promise me it's real<br>
Girl, I got a deal<br>
You could be my girl if I could be your world<br>
Cold Hart<br>
And we can leave this club<br>
And we can get fucked up<br>
In the back of the Chevy<br>
Girl, I felt your heart beatin' heavy for me<br>
And I just wanna see you shine<br>
Girl, you got stars for eyes<br>
And she sweet like Texas tea<br>
With an ass from Tennessee<br>
And we can take the long way home<br>
'Cause I don't wanna see you go<br>
Sittin' drinkin' whiskey, hopin' that you'll miss me<br>
Baby, say you do (please, say you do)<br>
